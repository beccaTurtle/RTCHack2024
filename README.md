## Inspiration

Many of the textbooks that are needed for college classes can be very expensive, especially if you have multiple classes and have to buy a whole set of new ones each semester. We wanted to create an application that would allow textbook lending within a campus in order to create a more affordable option for accessing textbooks and to empower students to create a community around helping each other out! 

## What it does

Our app essentially works like a community-based lending library for textbooks. You can search for the textbooks you need and find a list of users who have a copy of that book. You can also put your information down under any textbooks you own and add new textbooks to the library. 

## How we built it

We built our android app using Android Studio and in Java. 

## Challenges we ran into

One of our teammates was having consistent trouble pushing to the GitHub. We also had trouble implementing data persistence between one app session to the next and data sharing between users. Two challenges that we were able to overcome were figuring out how to use a RecyclerView in order to display a variable number of search results and users, and figuring out how to order our search results by relevance. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we were able to create a partially functioning prototype in only 2 days!

## What we learned

We learned collaboration and quick problem solving skills. We also deepened our understanding of Java and android app development.

## What's next for Book Buddy

Our next step would probably be to hook up our app with Google Firestore in order to share data between users over the internet!
